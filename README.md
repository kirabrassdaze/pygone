# PyGone Windows GUI Version

## Download PyGone Windows GUI Version

[Download pygone_combined.exe](https://github.com/kirabrassdaze/pygone/releases/download/pygone_combined_1.6.5_Windows/pygone_combined.exe)

## Project Overview

This project is a fork of the [PyGone](https://github.com/scs-ben/pygone) chess engine version 1.6.5. PyGone is a chess engine written in Python, known for its compact code size.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this fork is to create a Python-dependency-free version of PyGone that can be directly used with chess GUI interfaces on the Windows operating system for gameplay.

## Usage Instructions

### Direct Use of the Executable

1. Obtain the `pygone_combined.exe` file from the release or from the `dist` folder.
2. Add this engine in a UCI-compatible chess GUI (such as Arena Chess GUI, SCID, ChessBase, etc.).
3. Configure engine parameters and start playing.

### Rebuilding the Engine (If Needed)

1. Ensure Python and necessary dependencies are installed (python_minifier, pyinstaller).
2. Run `python windows_build.py` to generate the merged Python file.
3. Run `pyinstaller pygone_combined.spec` to generate a new executable.

## Key Modifications and Features

1. **Feature Restoration**: To improve stability and functionality for practical use, we have restored some features that were commented out in the original project due to size constraints.

2. **FEN Code Parsing Fix**: Modified the engine's handling of FEN positions followed by move sequences. The engine can now correctly process commands in the format: `position fen rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 moves e2e4 e7e5`.

3. **File Size Changes**: To achieve the above goals, we have sacrificed the original project's small size feature (the original project aimed for a Unix executable ≤4KB). This version is packaged with PyInstaller, resulting in an executable file size of approximately 8MB, but ensures direct execution on Windows systems without Python dependencies.

## Functional Limitations

**Please note that this version has the following limitations for gameplay:**

1. **Recommended Control Methods**: Only time control (e.g., 3 minutes + 2 seconds increment) or depth-limited search methods are recommended. Using other methods may cause the engine to function incorrectly.

2. **Missing STOP Command Support**: The engine does not implement the UCI protocol's stop command response mechanism.

3. **Limited Analysis Capability**: Due to the lack of stop command support, continuous analysis functionality is not available as in common engines - only single-move analysis is possible.

4. **Primary Use Limitation**: This executable is currently primarily limited to basic gameplay and is not suitable for advanced analysis or other complex scenarios.

## New File Explanation

1. **windows_build.py**: Windows-specific build script responsible for merging and minimizing multiple Python files in preparation for packaging.

2. **pygone_combined.spec**: PyInstaller packaging configuration file that specifies how to package the Python code into a standalone executable.

3. **src/pygone_combined.py**: Merged Python file generated by windows_build.py, containing all necessary modules.

4. **build folder**: Intermediate files and build outputs generated during the PyInstaller packaging process.

5. **dist folder**: Contains the final executable file `pygone_combined.exe`, which is the directly usable chess engine for Windows.

## License

This project is based on the original PyGone engine and follows the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Notes

- This version is optimized for the Windows environment and may not be compatible with other operating systems.
- Due to PyInstaller packaging, the executable file may trigger false positives in some security software. In such cases, please add the file to your security software's trust list.
- While sacrificing the original project's small size feature, we have maintained the core functionality and characteristics of the PyGone engine.
- Please be aware of the functional limitations mentioned above and use primarily for basic gameplay scenarios.
